# DellSophomoreAdvantage2020

-> The goal of this small project was to "create a user friendly solution that helps us address the needs of the IT Development Program PMs and participants." 

-> It is supposed to be an useful tool for ITDP Program participants, committee leads, and project managers to keep track of the variety of tasks & activities that are a part of the program. 

-> Currently this project is in a prototype stage, with an UI being fully mapped out via Figma (eventually will be in HTML and CSS) and the backend  being written in some capacity (Javascript). The next step in this process is to transfer the Figma design into HTML and CSS so that a static website is created. Eventually the back end will be redone to work correctly with a given database (and then can theoretically work with more data as long as its run through the program). Integration between the two will be essential and accordingly is the last step of the process to create the completed product. 

-> If you happen to stumble across this repository and spot any bugs in the backend or have any ideas for the front end please do let me know as I am very interested in building out this website as practice.
